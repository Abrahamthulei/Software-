# 🌍 AI for SDG 13: Predicting CO₂ Emissions with Machine Learning

This project uses supervised machine learning to forecast CO₂ emissions based on country-level data. The goal is to support proactive climate action and informed policy decisions.

---

## 🧠 Model
- ML Technique: Supervised Learning
- Algorithm: Random Forest Regressor
- Tools: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn

---

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: [Global Fossil CO₂ Emissions Dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datasets/co2-fossil-global/master/global.csv)

---

## 🛠 How to Run
1. Open the Jupyter notebook: `co2_forecast_model.ipynb`
2. Or use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
3. Run all cells to train and evaluate the model

---

## 📈 Results
- Model R² Score ≈ 0.85
- Emissions trends can be forecast with high accuracy

---

## 💡 Ethical Considerations
- ⚠ Bias may exist due to incomplete or inconsistent data reporting across countries.
- ✅ This model aims to promote fairness and sustainability in climate policy decisions.

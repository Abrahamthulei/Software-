Title: Predicting CO₂ Emissions with Machine Learning

SDG: SDG 13 – Climate Action

Problem: Climate change caused by increasing CO₂ emissions

ML Technique: Supervised Learning – Random Forest Regressor

Dataset: Global CO₂ emissions data (GitHub Dataset)

Results:
- R² Score ≈ 0.85
- Forecasted future CO₂ emissions with good accuracy

Ethical Considerations:
- Risk of bias due to underreporting
- Model promotes fairness by supporting data-driven policy decisions
